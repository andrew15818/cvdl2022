## Computer Vision and Deep Learning
Repo for my Fall 2022 course on computer vision and deep learning.
All the homework assignments open a GUI created with PyQt5.

There are three homework assignments:
- `hw1`: Focuses on camera calibration, finding the corners in a checkerboard pattern.
- `hw1-2`: Find keypoints and feature match across images, 
- `hw2`: Train a ResNet18 on a dataset with images of Cats & Dogs.
